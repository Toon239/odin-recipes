            <li>2 egg whites </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar </li>
            <li>⅔ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>¼ cup water </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons rose extract </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom </li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar together with an electric mixer on high speed
                until the mixture forms stiff peaks.</li>
            <li>Place sugar, water, rose extract, cardamom, salt, and food coloring in a saucepan, and bring to a simmer
                over low heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Simmer the mixture for a minute or two, stirring
                constantly, and very slowly pour the syrup in a thin stream into the egg whites, beating constantly with
                electric mixer on high speed. Beat until the syrup is incorporated and the meringue is stiff and shiny.
            </li>
            <li>Drop by spoonfuls or pipe into rosettes with a star tip onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the meringues are hard, 1 to 1 1/2 hours; turn off the oven, and allow
                them to cool inside the oven to finish baking the insides.</li>
